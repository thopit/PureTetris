PureTetris
==========
This project was done using libGDX (http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)
Because of this you need several repositories to get the program running:
To use the Android version you need this repository as well as the repository "PureTetris-android".
To use the desktop version you need this repository, the repository "PureTetris-android" and the repository "PureTetris-desktop".

To run the "PureTetris-android" project you also need to install the Android SDK.
It's possible to run the desktop version without installing the Android SDK, but the android project will display errors.
